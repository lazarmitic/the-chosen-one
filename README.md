## Guide

On start of the game u can chose difficulty level: 

1. Easy
2. Hard
3. Nightmare

There are three platforms, your goal is to collect as many pink cubes as u can while avoiding blue ones.
When u jump on side platforms to collect pink cubes, you need to use portals on left and right side of the map to get back to middle platform.
Left portal will teleport you on left side of the middle platform, right portal will teleport you on right side of the middle platform.

It's pretty simple so i hope you enjoy the game.
